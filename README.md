# What It Does
Our app allows users to track the food they've eaten and helps them identify potential causes of their allergic reactions. A user inputs the food item they have eaten (either through scanning product barcodes or manually entering recipe ingredients) and this is recorded on a log along with the date. On each food log entry, there is a checkbox for whether they have then had a negative reaction and started feeling ill after eating the product. If so, the ingredients of the product are analyzed to find a correlation with other foods that have resulted in a negative reaction to see if there are any shared ingredients. As the user scans more items, the app can narrow down which specific ingredients are the likeliest cause of the reaction. 

# How To Build
To build the project simply open the repository in Android studio (Version 4.2 or higher).

You can also use a mobile android device which is plugged into your computer and has USB debugging turned on.
Press the green play button to run the app and it will open the application on the android device selected.


If the app doesn't run, then use the build menu in android studio and press Clean build and then press Rebuild project.
